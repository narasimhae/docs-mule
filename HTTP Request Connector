The HTTP Request Connector provides the most practical way to consume an external HTTP service. 
When sending HTTP requests, you can choose what method to use (GET, POST, etc) and may include a body, headers, attachments, query parameters, form parameters and URI parameters. 
The response is then received by the connector and is passed on to the next element in your flow.
This connector can also implement HTTPS protocol and encrypt your communications via TLS, it can also implement authentication via basic authentication, OAuth, NTLM or digest.
The request connector is especially handy when consuming a RESTful API that is described in a RAML file. 
If you reference the API’s RAML file in the connector’s configuration, it proactively offers you the set of available resources and operations contained in the RAML file, 
as well as enforce the policies described in the file. It also exposes the API metadata to Studio, 
which can then be used by other elements such as DataWeave to autocomplete fields and make configuration much easier.
The connector can also send HTTP requests to addresses that aren’t associated to any RAML file – you can simply assign an address, 
select an HTTP method and optionally add additional parameters to your request.
